Contributing Code
=================

When proposing action, small or large, try always to start by identifying
the problems you want to solve. Only when you have a clear and real
problem on which everyone can agree, move to discussing solutions.

Discuss first, then start coding.

-  Each new feature should be discussed before any patches are provided;
-  Tickets are not assigned to anyone. If you want a feature, either provide a
   pull request or if possible consider offering someone money to work on the feature.
-  New feature implementations should start out with as minimal code possible,
   work towards a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

   radio or A/C, but it can drive.*
